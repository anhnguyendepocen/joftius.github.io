\section*{Course Description}

This course examines modern statistical methods as a basis for decision making in the face of uncertainty. Topics include probability theory, discrete and continuous distributions, hypothesis testing, estimation, and statistical quality control. With the aid of computers, these statistical methods are used to analyze data. Also presented are an introduction to statistical models and their application to decision making. Topics include the simple linear regression model, inference in regression analysis, sensitivity analysis, and multiple regression analysis.

\subsection*{Exam schedule}

The final exam is scheduled for May 10, from 8-9:50am. In-class midterm exams will be held on February 22, March 26, and April 17.

\item On certain days students will be asked to bring a laptop to class. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Tentative Outline}

Items listed under ``topics'' and the last section, on machine learning, should be considered outside of the core concepts of the class. They are included to indicate the context and importance of the core concepts in the ``modern'' era of data science and machine learning. Homework and exam questions will not require specific knowledge of these topics, and will only relate to the topics at most by asking how a particular core concept can be applied to them.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Experiments

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Randomized controlled trials
  \item Observational studies, confounding
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Description and visualization

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Summarizing data
  \item Histograms
  \item Other visualizations
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Probability basics

  \begin{itemize}
  \item History, games, sets, counting
  \item Random variables, expectation, variance
  \item Theorems: Chebyshev, Bayes
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Probability in statistics

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Estimation, bias and variance
  \item Sampling distributions, central limit theorem
  \item Topics: Stein's paradox, error propagation
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Confidence intervals and tests

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Intervals, error bars, $t$-distribution
  \item Interpretation
  \item Hypotheses, falsification
  \item Bootstrap and resampling methods
  \item Topics: multiple testing
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Regression

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Covariance, correlation, simple regression
  \item Prediction, intervals, tests, and interpretation
  \item Non-linearity, transformations, discrete predictors
  \item Multiple regression
  \item Topics: logistic regression, mixed effects models, causal inference
  \end{itemize}

\item Machine learning

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Model selection, complexity, validation
  \item Classification
  \item Unsupervised learning
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Course Policies}

\subsection*{General Rules}

\begin{itemize}
\item Be on time to class. Attendance is part of the grade.
\item Do not use mobile devices in class. Laptops may be used only for taking notes.
\item Late submission of assignments may be permitted with prior notice and on a case-by-case basis, but is generally \underline{highly discouraged} and may result in half credit for the assignment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Grading Policy}

Final grades will be determined as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{\textbf{30\%}} distributed equally for 3 in class midterms. 
    \item \underline{\textbf{20\%}} for a comprehensive final exam.
    \item \underline{\textbf{20\%}} for homework.
    \item \underline{\textbf{20\%}} for a project.
    \item \underline{\textbf{10\%}} for participation.
\end{itemize}

Participation will be determined mostly by objective measures like attendance. 

\subsection*{Code of Conduct}

All students are expected to follow the Stern Code of Conduct \url{http://www.stern.nyu.edu/uc/codeofconduct}. A student's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A duty to acknowledge the work and efforts of others when submitting work as one's own.
Ideas, data, direct quotations, paraphrasing, creative expression, or any other incorporation
of the work of others must be clearly referenced.
\item A duty to exercise the utmost integrity when preparing for and completing examinations, including an obligation to report any observed violations.
\item To minimize the temptation for copying or sharing during an exam, there will be multiple versions of every exam, and the seating order will be randomly assigned.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Accommodations for Different Abilities}
If you are qualified for academic accommodation of any kind during this course, you must notify me at the beginning of the course and provide a letter from the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD, 998-4980, www.nyu.edu/csd) verifying your registration and outlining the accommodations they recommend.  If you will need to take an exam at the CSD, you must submit a completed Exam Accommodations Form to them at least one week prior to the scheduled exam time to be guaranteed accommodation.

\subsection*{Health and Wellness}
To access the University's health and mental health resources, contact the NYU Wellness Exchange.
You can call its private hotline (212-443-9999), available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to reach out to a
professional who can help to address day-to-day challenges as well as other health-related concerns.
