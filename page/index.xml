      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a statistician and data scientist with a broad range of interests including theory, applications, and teaching with the R statistical programming language. My research focuses on common practices in machine learning and data science pipelines and addressing sources and types of error that have previously been overlooked. This includes, for example:
 Developing methods for inference after model selection such as p-values adjusted for selection bias Analyzing the social fairness of machine learning algorithms from a causal perspective  My work has been published in the Annals of Statistics and Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).</description>

      <description>Course description This course examines modern statistical methods as a basis for decision making in the face of uncertainty. Topics include probability theory, discrete and continuous distributions, hypothesis testing, estimation, and statistical quality control. With the aid of computers, these statistical methods are used to analyze data. Also presented are an introduction to statistical models and their application to decision making. Topics include the simple linear regression model, inference in regression analysis, sensitivity analysis, and multiple regression analysis.</description>

      <description>Causal inference in fairness This work approaches fair machine learning from a causal inference perspective, arguing that determining what is fair is a similar challenge to determining causality.
Press Some of this work was covered in the New Scientist and 36Kr.
